# Markdown previewer and editor

![screenshot](./screenshot.avif)

Simple little Markdown editor and previewer.

Made using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Svelte-Splitpanes](https://github.com/orefalo/svelte-splitpanes), [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it), and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for [High Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com/) as well as for my [FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/). Enjoy!
