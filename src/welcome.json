# Heading 1

Simple little Markdown editor and previewer.

Made using [Svelte
  ](https: //svelte.dev/), [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it), and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for [High Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com/) as well as for my [FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/). Enjoy!

\`\`\`cpp
int main() {
  std: :cout << "Hello, World!\\n";
  return 0;
  }

This is an *emphasis* and **this text is bold and _italic_**.`
